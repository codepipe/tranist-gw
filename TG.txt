Transit Gateway: 
================
is nothing but it is the centre point of  connecting the multiple vpc in same region
if its in different region in same account then need to do transit gateway peering like similar to vpc peering and also if its in different region in different aws account same thing need to do transit gateway peering 
===============
Pre-requsites:
==================
2 or more VPC and required subnets,Igw etc.

but in this case:
================
create 3 vpc in the same region ireland
vpc1--->10.150.0.0/16 and one public subnet and one private subnet
vpc2--->10.160.0.0/16 and one public subnet and one private subnet
vpc3--->10.170.0.0/16 and one public subnet and one private subnet

after that attached igw to only for vpc-1
========================================
after that created ec2 instance in vpc-1 under public subnet
after that created one more ec2 instance in vpc-2 under private subnet
after that created one more ec2 instance in vpc-3 under private subnet

steps to create transit gateway
===============================
step1:
=====
create a transit gateway and wait for available state

step2:
=====
create a transit gateway attachment and select attachment type
types are
vpc
vpn
peering connection
connect
and wait for available state

step3:
======
cross verify the attachment and propogation in transit gateway route tables

step4:
=====
go to each public and private route table vpc1 , vpc2 and vpc3 and
attach destination address to connect from 
vpc1 to vpc2 and vpc3
vpc2 to vpc3 and vpc1
vpc3 to vpc2 and vpc1

step5:
=======
aftet that login to ec2 machine which is hosted in vpc1 under public subnet and connect (ssh to machine2 in vpc2 and also machine3 in vpc3) the
ec2 hosted in private ec2 in vpc2
cross verify
